Howdy y'all.   Here's data from:

Pirrung, C.J.H., Singh G., Hogeveen, J., Quinn, D. & Cavanagh, J.F.  (2025) Hypoactivation of ventromedial frontal cortex in major depressive disorder: an MEG study of the Reward Positivity.   Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging

An MEG study (306-sensor Elekta Neuromag System) of the Reward Positivity during reinforcement learning.  Participants were all SCID interviewed to meet either control (CTL, non-depressed, n=38) or major depressive disorder (MDD, n=52) group criteria.   Task was an MEG-compatible probabilistic selection task.  We'll upload their T1s and resting state soon.   <jcavanagh@unm.edu>
